# #indieracers Guidelines

#indieracers is a weekly Twitter event designed to boost the visibility of indie racing games which are currently in development or have been out for <1 year.

## Goals

* Create a weekly digest of all racing dev news, that followers, press and publishers can easily read!
* Share some love, increase visibility by sharing posts and comments about our games!
* Rotating host every week that reaches different audiences and timezones!

### Sunday’s Discussion

The host creates a post with their news, making clear that they are the host for this week, and invites other devs to post fresh news in the comments (e.g. a link to the lastest #screenshotsaturday post).

Sunday’s thread is also an opportunity to spur discussion amongst devs as well as interact with followers. Anybody is encouraged to join the discussion and offer encouragement/support/feedback to all the developers!

### Tuesday’s Switch

Sunday's host randomly chooses the next host from all the devs that took part in that week's discussion and notifies them (including a link to the guidelines).

One recommended way to do that is to retweet their own discussion post, inviting followers who missed it (or who read it before all news were posted) to review the thread and catch up on all the latest #indieracers news!
